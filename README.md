# M3_Project
# Wiper Control System 
## Introduction
### This project is all about designing a wiper control system for cars.
### We denote intensity of rain by the frequency in which the lights alternate between the four colours.
### The switch indicates ON/OFF 
### We use STM32cube IDE and Qemu for emulating the operation.
### As qemu supports only 4 LEDs and a Switch, we make use of LEDs to notify the operations.
