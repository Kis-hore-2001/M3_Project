# Abstract
### In automobiles, particularly cars, autos and heavy vehicles, there are wipers.
### Wipers are used to clean the windshield of the cars to operate these wipers, motors are used. these motors are designed to operate in 90 degrees or 150 degrees, depending on the use.
### This is so because Qemu supports only those things.
### We use single press and long press to denote ON/OFF and frequencies to denote varoius wiper operations.
### I have not used 180 degrees here, because no wiper in real time rotates 180 degrees.
### As STM32IDE is used, along with Qemu, we will show this operation using only 4 LEDs and a switch.
# Introduction
### This project is all about designing a wiper control system for cars.
### We denote intensity of rain by the frequency in which the lights alternate between the four colours.
### The switch indicates ON/OFF
### We use STM32cube IDE and Qemu for emulating the operation.
### As qemu supports only 4 LEDs and a Switch, we make use of LEDs to notify the operations.
# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
### STM32 CUBE IDE
# COMPONENTS
### STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
# DESCRIPTION
### STM32F407VG
### The STM32F407 Kit takes advantage of the high-performance STM32F407 microcontrollers' capabilities to make it simple for users to create audio-based applications. It comes with an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, an ST-MEMS digital accelerometer, a digital microphone, an audio DAC with integrated class D speaker driver, LEDs, pushbuttons, and a USB OTG micro-AB connector.Ethernet connectivity, an LCD display, and other features have been added to the STM32F4 DISCOVERY kit. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx families are built around the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core, which runs at up to 168 MHz.
# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
### In a LQFP100 package, the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller has a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 with FPU core, 1-Mbyte Flash memory, and 192-Kbyte RAM.
### On-board ST-LINK/V2 or ST-LINK/V2-A on STM32F4 DISCOVERY (old reference) or STM32F407G-DISC1 (new order code)
### USB ST-LINK with three separate interfaces and re-enumeration capability.
### Virtual Com port Debug port (with new order code only).
### Large-scale storage (with new order code only).
### Board power is supplied through USB or an external 5 V supply source.
### 3 V and 5 V external application power supply.
