# Abstract
### In automobiles, particularly cars, autos and heavy vehicles, there are wipers.
### Wipers are used to clean the windshield of the cars to operate these wipers, motors are used. these motors are designed to operate in 90 degrees or 150 degrees, depending on the use.
### This is so because Qemu supports only those things.
### We use single press and long press to denote ON/OFF and frequencies to denote varoius wiper operations.
### I have not used 180 degrees here, because no wiper in real time rotates 180 degrees.
### As STM32IDE is used, along with Qemu, we will show this operation using only 4 LEDs and a switch.
# Introduction
### This project is all about designing a wiper control system for cars.
### We denote intensity of rain by the frequency in which the lights alternate between the four colours.
### The switch indicates ON/OFF
### We use STM32cube IDE and Qemu for emulating the operation.
### As qemu supports only 4 LEDs and a Switch, we make use of LEDs to notify the operations.
